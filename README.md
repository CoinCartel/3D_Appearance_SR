# Quick
## Prepare pretrained model
Download our pretrained model for 3D appearance SR from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_MjdHD8GHrZv37p9_vd2sgUB1T787RhC?usp=sharing). The pretrained models for NLR and NHR are included.
Download the pretrained EDSR model from [EDSR project page](https://github.com/thstkdgus35/EDSR-PyTorch).

Put the pretrained model at ./experiment
## Prepare dataset
For fast use of the code, please refer to [demo.sh](./code/scripts/demo.sh). In a batch system, you can also use [qsub_NLR.sh](./code/scripts/qsub_NLR.sh).
